# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally identifiable information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.

## Information Collection and Use
XXX Community acts as an information collection and distribution system for the purpose of allowing our clients to make effective employment decisions. Information needed by our clients to make employment decisions is collected by our software and stored on our servers. Our clients then access this information via our secure software in order to make hiring decisions about you. Your resume and other information about you is collected in the following ways:

When you complete your resume on XXX Community website such as XXXinafrica.com
When you email your resume to an email address located in a domain owned by XXX Community such as info@XXXinafrica.com
When you fax your resume to a fax number that is owned or controlled by XXX Community.
The main purpose of collecting this information is for making employment decisions about you. Since XXX Community does not own the right to use your data in any way other than outlined in the paragraphs below (our client pays for this right), they are ultimately responsible for the use of this information. XXX Community will only use your data in aggregate (no personally identifiable information about you will be disclosed to another third party without your permission). XXX Community is responsible for ensuring that your information is protected from outside disclosure, and each of our clients is contractually obligated to protect your information and to adhere to this privacy statement.
We may collect and maintain the following information about you:

```
	Physical contact information
	Online contact information
	Demographic data
	Given Name (First Name)
	Family Name (Last Name)
	User's Job Title
	Name of User's Employer
	Government-issued identifiers
```

From time to time our clients may also use your information for the following other purposes:

Updates related to your hiring status (offer letters, rejection letters, etc)
Requests for additional information required to make a hiring decision
Background investigation our clients may use your information to verify information you have provided. You will always have to opt-in to this use of your information.
Direct marketing - you may receive emailed or snail mail newsletters or other information related to the company to which you have applied.
Log Files

Like most standard Web site servers, we collect information through our log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyse trends. We use this information to administer the site, track users movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This information is not linked to personally identifiable information.
This data will be used for the following purposes:

Completion and support of the current activity.
Web site and system administration.
Research and development.
This data will be used by us and our agents.

## Sharing
When you submit your information to our clients through the XXX Community, it is assumed that you understand that your information will be used for hiring decisions made by our clients. The only parties that have access to your personally identifiable information are:

Our client's recruiters, managers, or system administrators that have been granted access to the XXX Community. Each user agrees to protect your information and adhere to this privacy policy.
XXX Community technical and support personnel that have been specially trained to protect your information and adhere to this policy.
XXX Community does not own the right to use your personally identifiable information in any way unless specifically requested by you. The client company to which you are applying for a job owns this right to use your information for the purposes described in this document.

Our clients have the ability to export your personally identifiable information from our system into a system controlled by the client. Our client is contractually obligated to use this information only for the purposes described in this document, and to protect your information from outside disclosure. While we have made every effort to ensure information integrity of exported data, XXX Community is not responsible for information disclosure once it has been exported or emailed from our system.

We also may provide your personally identifiable information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personally identifiable information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)

We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and advertisers. We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.

We have partner companies that sell our product in addition to their own (as a complete solution or as an up-sell to their own product.) Our partner companies never have access to your personally identifiable information, but will receive aggregate data related to the performance to advertising and other data including:

NOTE: Aggregate data could be in total or for a particular time period specified by the client.

Number of applicants applying for a particular job
Average application quality - our software allows our clients to specify qualitative (such as resume keywords) and quantitative (such as years’ experience) criteria related to the job requirements. Each criterion is assigned a weight, and a score is produced based on how the applicant answers questions. The average score is provided to our partners as a measure of applicant quality
Number of applicants and average score in each hiring status (Inbox, hiring, consideration, in process, etc.)
Number of applicants and average score by recruiter assigned to work the application.
Other non-personally identifiable aggregate reports defined by our clients.
We use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online and make ads more relevant ("Remarketing”). Remarketing cookies will be used by third parties (including Google) to show our ads on websites other than our own.

Both us and third parties (including Google) will also use Remarketing cookies — both first party (such as Google Analytics) and third party — to serve more relevant ads to users based on such users’ past visits to our website, whether those users are on our Website or on other websites.
